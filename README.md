## About the specialization
Dive into cutting-edge development tools like PyTorch, Lightning, and Hugging Face, and streamline your workflow with VSCode, Git, and Conda. You'll learn how to harness the power of the cloud with AWS and Colab to train massive deep learning models with lightning-fast GPU acceleration. Plus, you'll master best practices for managing a large number of experiments with Weights and Biases. And that's just the beginning! This course will also teach you how to systematically read research papers, generate new ideas, and present them in slides or papers. You'll even learn valuable project management and team communication techniques used by top AI researchers. Don't miss out on this opportunity to level up your AI skills.
